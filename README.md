# AutoSC2Rep

AutoSC2Rep is an incomplete web app that was intended to allow players streaming StarCraft2 games to automatically save their replays and upload them to our service using Dropbox's automatic file uploads.  The app is incomplete, but there are still useful parts of the code, such as the Dropbox integration.
